## Favicon Update Instructions

Your application currently uses a default favicon. To properly brand your app, you should:

### 1. Create Custom Favicon Files
You'll need to create these icon files and place them in the `frontend/public/` folder:

- `favicon.ico` (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes in one file)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `favicon-16x16.png` 
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `android-chrome-192x192.png`
- `android-chrome-512x512.png`

### 2. Design Suggestions
For a civic reporting app, consider icons with:
- Building/city skyline
- Location pin
- Document/report symbol
- Shield (representing safety/civic duty)
- Eye (representing transparency)

### 3. Tools to Create Favicons
- Use online generators like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
- Upload a square logo (at least 512x512px)
- Download the generated favicon package

### 4. Current Placeholder
The existing favicon.ico is a generic placeholder that should be replaced before hosting.

### 5. Browser Cache
After updating favicons, users might need to clear their browser cache to see the new icons.
